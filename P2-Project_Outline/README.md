### Overview
This dog boarding reservation system is a versatile, employee-centered tool that allows the dog-lovers to make the dogs' stay as painless as possible. This application will be an efficient multi-tool for every employee at this job. Capable of accepting reservations from the receptionist pov, to the communication board updating the manager of the dogs stay every step of the way by the caretakers. 
With a search function to easily find any of our four-legged tenants, we can update the owner of any health concerns and vice-versa they are able to easily provide the caretakers of the diet restrictions that they must follow during the dogs stay. Once the owners pick-up the furry family members, they are provided with an easy to access invoice that is sent to there email and can then link them to a payment portal in which they can provide the dog boarding company with payment in return for the painless, time apart from their beloved pet.

### Technologies
Backend - Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate
Front End - Thymeleaf, payment and calendar API to be determined

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will specifically be learning how to work with APIs in regards to a calendar system. I will also be expanding my knowloedge of the thymeleaf templates and how to use them to incorporate our code. Scaffolding the models in java to then translate to the database. We are looking to make this application reactive to the devices specified DOM size with bootstrap.
